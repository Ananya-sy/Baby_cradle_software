IoT Smart Baby Cradle

The IoT Smart Cradle is an embedded systems project designed to improve infant care and parental convenience. The system uses sensors to detect baby movement and sound, triggering automated cradle rocking and sending real-time alerts to parents through IoT connectivity.

üöÄ Features

Motion & Sound Detection: Sensors monitor baby activity in real time.

Automated Rocking: Motorized cradle movement activates when needed.

IoT Connectivity: Sends notifications/alerts to parents‚Äô mobile devices.

Safety Features: Threshold-based alerts for abnormal activity.

Embedded Firmware: Efficient data acquisition, motor control, and communication.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Hardware: Sensors (motion, sound), Motor, Microcontroller

Software/Firmware: Embedded C / Arduino IDE (if applicable), IoT communication protocols

IoT: Cloud/Mobile integration for alerts and monitoring
